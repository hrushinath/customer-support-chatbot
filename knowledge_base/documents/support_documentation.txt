=== TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE ===

Common Issues and Solutions:

1. Chatbot won't initialize
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Check model is pulled: `ollama pull mistral`
   - Verify Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check port 11434 is not blocked

2. Out of memory errors
   - Switch to smaller model (e.g., phi instead of mistral)
   - Reduce embedding batch size in config
   - Close other applications

3. Slow response times
   - Check CPU usage - ensure no other heavy processes
   - Consider quantized model: `ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0`
   - Reduce chunk context size in config

4. Inaccurate answers
   - Check knowledge base documents are loaded correctly
   - Verify document formatting
   - Increase top_k chunks in config
   - Review RAG prompt in config.py

5. Vector database corruption
   - Delete vector_store folder
   - Restart application to rebuild index
   - All knowledge will be rebuilt from source documents

=== OPTIMIZATION TIPS ===

For faster performance:
- Use quantized model versions
- Reduce embedding batch size
- Disable source attribution if not needed
- Use CPU acceleration with proper processor

For better accuracy:
- Increase top_k to 10-15
- Lower relevance threshold to 0.3
- Add more specific documents to knowledge base
- Fine-tune RAG prompt for your use case

For lower memory usage:
- Use smaller embedding model
- Use smaller LLM (Phi-3 over Mistral 7B)
- Limit vector store size
- Reduce batch sizes

=== UPDATES AND PATCHES ===

We regularly release updates to improve performance and accuracy.
To update:
1. Backup your knowledge_base and vector_store folders
2. Download latest version
3. Run: python src/app.py (it will rebuild indexes)
