Chatbot won't initialize\n   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`\n   - Check model is pulled: `ollama pull mistral`\n   - Verify Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n   - Check port 11434 is not blocked",

Out of memory errors\n   - Switch to smaller model (e.g., phi instead of mistral)\n   - Reduce embedding batch size in config\n   - Close other applications\n\n3. Slow response times\n   - Check CPU usage - ensure no other heavy processes\n   - Consider quantized model: `ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0`\n   - Reduce chunk context size in config\n\n4. Inaccurate answers\n   - Check knowledge base documents are loaded correctly\n   - Verify document formatting\n   - Increase top_k chunks in config\n   - Review RAG prompt in config.py\n\n5. Vector database corruption\n   - Delete vector_store folder\n   - Restart application to rebuild index\n   - All knowledge will be rebuilt from source documents\n\n=== OPTIMIZATION TIPS ===",
